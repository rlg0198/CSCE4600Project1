##How to run

 - Open folder in command prompt
 - run by typing "go run main.go example_processess.csv"


## Project 1: Process Scheduler

- First Come First Serve (FCFS) [already done]
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- SJF Priority
- Round-robin (RR)

The format for this record is the following: \<ProcessID>,\<Burst Duration>,\<Arrival Time>,\<Priority>.

Objectives:
   1. Implement SJF (preemptive) and report average turnaround time, average waiting time, and average throughput.

   2. Implement SJF priority scheduling (preemptive) and report average turnaround time, average waiting time, and average throughput.

   3. Round-round (preemptive) and report average turnaround time, average waiting time, and average throughput.

## Grading

Code must compile and run.

Each type is worth different points:

- 30 points for implementing FCFS (already done, so you get 30 points for just submitting)
- 25 points for implementing SJF [preemptive]
- 25 points for implementing SJF Priority scheduling [preemptive]
- 20 points for implementing RR [always preemptive]
